Installation should be rather simple.

Dependencies: glibc-headers pam-devel perl openssl-devel at

From package root type:

make
sudo make install

This has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04LTS and RHEL7.

Be carefull with the uninstaller in Ubuntu.  We have to manipulate other elements (specifically 
pam_unix.so) of the PAM stack to make things work.  If you try to uninstall an improperly installed
PAM Stack it WILL SCREW IT UP AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LOGIN!!!  You have been warned.
